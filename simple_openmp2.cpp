//What you are seeing is normal behavior for parallel output. When multiple threads write to cout at the same time, their messages can interleave in unpredictable ways. That is why you see strings merging into each other rather than printing neatly on separate lines.

//Why Does This Happen?
//Each thread is writing to the standard output buffer concurrently.
//Even though you used endl (which does flush the stream), OpenMP doesnâ€™t guarantee that each thread will atomically print its entire line.
//Consequently, the strings from different threads can get mixed or partially overwritten.
